			<p>It all started with a phone call on a sunny afternoon in May 2012.</p>
			<p>Yifan was on the inbound train to Boston when she called her friend Chinee who just got out of shower in gloomy Seattle. After several minutes of talk on the phone, Best Before started to take shape. In late June, as soon as they got back to their hometown â€“ Shanghai, China, without a second of hesitation, they embarked on their photography studio--Best Before.</p>
			<p>"Best Before" represents the idea of "capturing the moment." Nobody can turn back the clock, but through Best Before, we want to freeze the best moment and let it last beyond time.</p>
			<p>Shanghai, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City... We captured moments for clients, models and brands. We love how photography gives us the opportunity to meet new people, travel around and explore beauty.</p>
			<p>We strike to freeze those very special moments of yours so that years later, when you look at the pictures again, they could take you back to those moments.</p>
			<p>We are Chinee and Yifan, founders of Best Before. Through our lens, we lock the Best--Before it fades away.</p>
